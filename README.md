# computerCraftMiningTurtle
To be used with the mod computer craft. 

The quarry function only works with odd numbers like 3x3x3 or 5x5x5. Even numbers like 2x2x2 or 4x4x4 just makes stairs instead of a big hole.
The mining turtle works best if you have modded ender chests. One ender chest in the first inv slot allows the turtle to empty inventory. The second ender chest in the second slot allows the turtle to refuel itself.
